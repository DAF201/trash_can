Phonograph
Nothing can I forget if nothing I remember.
People are living in the same but different world as we do. We choicely ignore the presentation of them, avoid mentioning them, ingeniously change the subject to evade any communications about them to keep out the brittle and beautiful atmosphere. When a standard mid-class American is driving through a viaduct, complaining about the oil price and traffic jam, someone is dying, not a starving African child, but a homeless person under the viaduct in the shadow of the city. Not only foreigners we are ignoring, but also people who step away from us. Like a phonograph, parts we have are parts we want; the remains go with the wind. Were they killed by a dagger called poverty? Yes, and the hand called disregard was waving it. Besides the reason for the high living cost, reasons of homeless people are on the rim are the “myths and stereotypes” about those “‘invisible’ population” and the “very limited resources” which are “unresponsive to their needs.” Year by year, isolationism is no longer only a national strategy. Instead, it becomes something in bone, an eternal arrogance. The intemperate evaluation class and the pathological tutelage over the vacuous bubble may result in the exhausting life and the deprivation of interpersonal relationships using class and wealth as “the one unambiguous criterion of success” or a “sovereign American value.” Also, non-intervention is only to a bystander. When calamity knocks on the front door, standing aside is not a valid option to its victim. In such an environment, what chance do victims have of people standing out to practice a “complex and risky behavior that requires both personal skills and self-confidence?” 
All that remains is the hollow vanity of a weathered coin-operated phonograph.
